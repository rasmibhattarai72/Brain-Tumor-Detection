# Brain-Tumor-Detection
The objective of the project is to detect brain tumors by analyzing MRI images.


This is a multi-class image classification project. There are four classes of MRI images:
1. Glioma
2. Meningioma
3. Pituitary
4. No tumor

- 'Glioma', 'Meningioma' and 'Pituitary' are the three types of brain-tumor. 'No tumor' class indicates the absence of brain tumor. 
- For the purpose of image classification, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed in combination with transfer learning techniques.
- Throughout the training process, the model's performance was evaluated using the accuracy metric, while the optimization algorithm used was Adam.
- The model achieved an accuracy rate of 97% on the training set and 95% on the test set.
